# Arduino-data-logging-device
This was used for rapidly prototyping an IOT system, but could make a really fun and cheap project for beginners.

The Arduino data logging device is used to measure the temperature, humidity and level of moisture in soil. This could be used to do something like monitor house plants or greenhouse conditions. 
The way this device works is by getting readings off of a DHT11(Digital,Humidity and Temperature) sensor and a capacitive soil moisture sensor. This data is then formatted and relayed to a computer using serial communication.

This parts that are required are:

1 Arduino Uno /n \n
1 USB 2.0 A to B cable
1 DHT11 sensor
1 Capacitive Soil Moisture sensor
1 Breadboard
6 male-to-male jumper wires

needed can be found at some local electronics stores, and can usually be ordered online. 
Here are links where you can find more information about the components.
